= Python Test Container

This is a test container that I use to have an isolated build enviroonment.
One of the main uses for this is runing and testing ansible in "clean room".
I found a need for this as I use pyenv on my Mac and when doing some localhost loop back run it causes issues as the shell do not know how to run pyenv.

== Building The Container

To build the container run the following command:

[source, shell]
----
podman build -t python-test .
----
